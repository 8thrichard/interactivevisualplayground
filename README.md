# Interactive Visual Playground

## Description
An interactive visual playground featuring multiple modes such as dynamic background colors, animated objects, pattern generation, and a random walk animation. The project is designed to be controlled through keyboard inputs and mouse movement, offering a playful and engaging way to explore different graphical effects.

### Features:
1. **Dynamic Background**: The background color changes dynamically based on the mouse position on the screen.
2. **Animated Object**: A bouncing ball that moves around the canvas, changing direction when hitting the canvas boundaries.
3. **Pattern Generation**: A grid of randomly colored squares is generated to create unique patterns every time.
4. **Random Walk**: A random walker moves around the screen, leaving a colorful trail behind it. The walker wraps around the edges of the canvas.

## Controls
- **Press 1**: Switch to the **Dynamic Background** mode.
- **Press 2**: Switch to the **Animated Object** mode.
- **Press 3**: Switch to the **Pattern Generation** mode.
- **Press 4**: Switch to the **Random Walk** mode.
- **Press 'M'**: Show or hide the menu.

## Instructions
- **Mouse movement**: When the mouse is moved, it triggers the welcome message to disappear and the animation to begin.
- **Pressing a mode number** (1, 2, 3, or 4) switches to the corresponding animation mode.
- **Press 'M'** to toggle the menu visibility, which allows you to switch modes at any time.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the HTML file in your browser, or use a local server to run it.
3. You can interact with the animation by moving the mouse and pressing the keys as described above.

## Example Output
- **Dynamic Background**: The background color changes smoothly as you move the mouse across the screen.
- **Animated Object**: A ball bounces around the screen, changing direction when it hits the edges.
- **Pattern Generation**: A colorful grid of rectangles appears on the screen.
- **Random Walk**: A random walker leaves a colorful trail as it moves around the screen.
